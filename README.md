# ABIGAIL (WIP)

## Our Game

Our game is a time-traveling western mystery with a unique mix of 2D platformer and 2.5D top-down gameplay. Players explore a Western ghost town as a modern protagonist with
retro-cognition, witnessing past events through a mystical artifact. The game seamlessly transitions between 2D and 2.5D views, enhancing visual storytelling and gameplay depth.

The core of the game involves unraveling century-old mysteries using the artifact to witness historical events, providing critical clues. Puzzle-solving is crucial, requiring
players to think critically and use past knowledge. The blend of 2D platformer and 2.5D top-down views in a Western setting creates a distinctive aesthetic and gameplay experience.
The time-travel and retro-cognition elements offer a fresh twist, engaging players in an immersive story across different eras. This game promises an exciting journey through time,
blending action, exploration, and narrative for mystery, western, and innovative gameplay fans.
